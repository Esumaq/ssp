# Static split parser

A header only "csv" parser which is fast and versatile with modern C++ api. Requires compiler with C++17 support. 

Conversion for numeric values taken from [Oliver Sch√∂nrock](https://gist.github.com/oschonrock/67fc870ba067ebf0f369897a9d52c2dd) .   
Function traits taken from [qt-creator](https://code.woboq.org/qt5/qt-creator/src/libs/utils/functiontraits.h.html) .   

# Example 
Lets say we have a csv file containing students in the 
following format <name,age,grade>:

```
$ cat students.csv
James Bailey,65,2.5
Brian S. Wolfe,40,11.9
Nathan Fielder,37,Really good grades
Bill (Heath) Gates,65,3.3
```
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ss/parser.hpp>

int main() {
    ss::parser p{"students.csv", ","};
    if (!p.valid()) {
        std::cout << p.error_msg() << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    while (!p.eof()) {
        auto [name, age, grade] = p.get_next<std::string, int, double>();

        if (p.valid()) {
            std::cout << name << ' ' << age << ' ' << grade << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

And if we compile and execute the program we get the following output:

```
$ ./a.out
James Bailey 65 2.5
Brian S. Wolfe 40 11.9
Bill (Heath) Gates 65 3.3
```

# Usage

## Error handling

Detailed error messages can be accessed via the **error_msg** method, and to   
enable them the error mode has to be changed to **error_mode::String** using   
the **set_error_mode** method:  
```cpp
void parser::set_error_mode(ss::error_mode);
const std::string& parser::error_msg();
bool parser::valid();
bool parser::eof();
```
Error messages can always be disabled by setting the error mode to  
**error_mode::Bool**. An error can be detected using the **valid** method which   
would return **false** if the file could not be opened, or if the conversion   
could not be made (invalid types, invalid number of columns, ...).  
The **eof** method can be used to detect if the end of the file was reached.  

## Conversions
The above example will be used to show some of the features of the library.  
As seen above, the **get_next** method returns a tuple of objects specified  
inside the template type list.   

If a conversion could not be applied, the method would return a tuple of  
default constructed objects, and **valid** would return **false**, for example  
if the third (grade) column in our csv could not be converted to a double  
the conversion would fail. 

If **get_next** is called with a **tuple** it would behave identically to passing  
the same tuple parameters to **get_next**:  
```cpp
using student = std::tuple<std::string, int, double>;

// returns std::tuple<std::string, int, double>
auto [name, age, grade] = p.get_next<student>();
```
*Note, it does not always return a student tuple since the returned tuples  
parameters may be altered as explained below (no void, no restrictions, ...)*  

Whole objects can be returned using the **get_object** function which takes the  
tuple, created in a similar way as **get_next** does it, and creates an object  
out of it:
```cpp
struct student {
    std::string name;
    int age;
    double grade;
};
```
```cpp
// returns student
auto student = p.get_object<student, std::string, int, double>();
```
This works with any object if the constructor could be invoked using the  
template arguments given to **get_object**:  
```cpp
// returns std::vector<std::string> containing 3 elements
auto vec = p.get_object<std::vector<std::string>, std::string, std::string, 
                        std::string>();
```
And finally, using something I personally like to do, a struct (class) with a **tied**   
method witch returns a tuple of references to to the members of the struct.  
```cpp
struct student {
    std::string name;
    int age;
    double grade;

    auto tied() { return std::tie(name, age, grade); }
};
```
The method can be used to compare the object, serialize it, deserialize it, etc.   
Now **get_next** can accept such a struct and deduce the types to which to convert the csv.
```cpp
// returns student
auto s = p.get_next<student>();
```
*Note, the order in which the members of the tied method are returned must   
match the order of the elements in the csv*

### Special types 

Passing **void** makes the parser ignore a column.   
In the given example **void** could be given as the second  
template parameter to ignore the second (age) column in the csv, a tuple   
of only 2 parameters would be retuned:  
```cpp
// returns std::tuple<std::string, double>
auto [name, grade] = p.get_next<std::string, void, double>();
```
Works with different types of conversions too:
```cpp
using student = std::tuple<std::string, void, double>;

// returns std::tuple<std::string, double>
auto [name, grade] = p.get_next<student>();
```
To ignore a whole row, **ignore_next** could be used, returns **false** if **eof**: 
```cpp
bool parser::ignore_next();
```
**std::optional** could be passed if we wanted the conversion to proceed in the  
case of a failure returning **std::nullopt** for the specified column: 

```cpp
// returns std::tuple<std::string, int, std::optional<double>>
auto [name, age, grade] = p.get_next<std::string, int, std::optional<double>();
if(grade) {
    // do something with grade
}
```
Similar to **std::optional**, **std::variant** could be used to try other   
conversions if the previous failed _(Note, conversion to std::string will   
always pass)_:   
```cpp
// returns std::tuple<std::string, int, std::variant<double, char>>
auto [name, age, grade] = 
    p.get_next<std::string, int, std::variant<double, char>();
if(std::holds_alternative<double>(grade)) {
    // grade set as double
} else if(std::holds_alternative<char>(grade)) {
    // grade set as char
}
```
### Restrictions

Custom **restrictions** can be used to narrow down the conversions of unwanted  
values. **ss::ir** (in range) and **ss::ne** (none empty) are one of those:   
```cpp
// ss::ne makes sure that the name is not empty
// ss::ir makes sure that the grade will be in range [0, 10]
// returns std::tuple<std::string, int, double>
auto [name, age, grade] = 
    p.get_next<ss::ne<std::string>, int, ss::ir<double, 0, 10>>();
```
If the restrictions are not met, the conversion will fail.  
Other predefined restrictions are **ss::ax** (all except), **ss::nx** (none except)   
and **ss::oor** (out of range): 
```cpp
// all ints exept 10 and 20
ss::ax<int, 10, 20>
// only 10 and 20
ss::nx<int, 10, 20>
// all values except the range [0, 10]
ss::oor<int, 0, 10>
```
To define a restriction, a class/struct needs to be made which has a   
**ss_valid** method which returns a **bool** and accepts one object. The type of the  
conversion will be the same as the type of the passed object within **ss_valid**   
and not the restriction itself. Optionally, an **error** method can be made to   
describe the invalid conversion.  
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct even {
    bool ss_valid(const T& value) const {
        return value % 2 == 0;
    }

    // optional
    const char* error() const {
        return "number not even";
    }
};

// ...
// only even numbers will pass
// returns std::tuple<std::string, int>
auto [name, age] = p.get_next<std::string, even<int>, void>();
